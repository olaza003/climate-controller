# fan-controller

Copy the code to an arduino ide and go to the link next to the library. Download that library and implement it to be able to use it. Follow the wiring diagram shown and run the code.

What I've learned while doing this project:
  * Utilizing synchSM for understable and faster code. 
  * Able to create multiple inputs and not have clash each other. 
  * Create an arduino project from scratch.
